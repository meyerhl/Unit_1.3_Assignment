# Unit_1.3_Assignment

The purpose of this assignment is to write a Java program that prompts
the user for a decimal number and then displays to the screen the binary
equivalent as a string. This must use division, modulo and concatenation.

Note: I used BlueJ as my Java IDE rather than Eclipse. I find the user
interface much more intuitive than Eclipse IDE. While I lose the 
auto-complete feature when entering functions, I find that this
facilitates my learning so I'm OK with the tradeoff.
